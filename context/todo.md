* create a second language
    - first, move the current ast, parser to `languages.microml`
    - this task is to design, and spec, not yet build 
    - new language:
        - imperative
        - small like MicroML
        - call it NanoProc
            - in package `languages.nanoproc`
    - design questions:
        - can we use the same internal representation?
        - others here.



* define the graph api
* ingest the ast into the graph
